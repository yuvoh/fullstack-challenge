# CopoFi Full-stack Challenge
## Movie Database Tool

Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test, we know they take a while to complete, but they provide us invaluable information to ensure we hire the best people!

You will be building a small web app that integrates into a movies database. You will be building the front-end and an API that interacts with the database. You'll find below the product specifications (in the form of user stories) and technical specifications your app should meet. The task is fairly open-ended, so build the app as you see fit, and feel free to extend the functionality with some idea of your own if you wish.

### Product Specifications
Your app should satisfy the following four user stories:

**As a** user running the application
**I can** search for movies by their title
**So that** I can find the movie I'm looking for.

**As a** user running the application
**I can** see the director, and the list of actors with the roles they played for each movie
**So that** I am able to check the cast of a movie.

**As a** user running the application
**I can** search using the name of an actor
**So that** I can find all the movies my favourite actor is in


#### Optional Extensions
You may extend the app in any way you think is interesting. Be sure to mention any extra work
you did in your submission so we don't miss it! Here are two example extensions:

**As a** user running the application
**I can** filter search results by year and rank
**So that** I can narrow down large search results

**As a** user running the application
**I can** see the highest ranking movie of each decade
**So that** I know which was the best movie each decade.


## Technical Specification

### Database

The database runs on a MySQL server hosted in the cloud. Below are the schema and connection details.

![schema](https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/assets/img/datasets-generated/imdb_ijs.svg)

To connect:

host=```imdb.yuvoh.com```
database=```imdb```,
username=```candidate```,
password=```yuvoh```
port=```3306```

### Platform choice
- The API should be built using Node.js. You may use a framework on top (such as Express) if you wish.
- The front-end should be built using a modern web framework (e.g React, Angular)

## Guidelines
- Spend as much or as little time as you wish, but try to complete the core functionality if possible!
- Focus on good development practices rather than flashy features.
- Feel free to implement functionality in the way you think is best, as long as the user stories are satisfied.

## Submission
Your project should contain everything needed to run your app, *excluding* your ```node_modules``` folder.

Please include a README file explaining the step(s) needed to run your app along with the answers to the following questions:

1. How long did you spend on the challenge?
2. What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
3. Is there anything about the full-stack challenge you did not like?
4. If you added additional features, what did you do?
5. Any other comments!

You can either place your project in a ZIP file and email it to us **OR** upload it to a GIT repository and send us a link.

Thanks for your time, and happy coding!
